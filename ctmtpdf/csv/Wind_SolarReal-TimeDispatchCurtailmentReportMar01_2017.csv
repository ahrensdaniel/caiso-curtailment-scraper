"Wind and Solar Curtailment March 01, 2017",
This report is produced daily to provide a detailed accounting of the wind and solar renewable,
generation that was curtailed and the reasons why1. This report should be read in the context of,
the Renewables Watch report for a more complete understanding of both renewable curtailment,
and generation2.,
Wind and solar curtailments are grouped into the following categories:,
1.,Economic - Local: Market dispatch of generators with economic bids to mitigate local
,congestion3.
2.,Economic - System: Market dispatch of generators with economic bids to mitigate system-
,wide oversupplyೕ.
3.,SelfSchCut - Local: Market dispatch of self-schedules to mitigate local congestion.
4.,SelfSchCut - System: Market dispatch of self-schedules to mitigate system-wide
,oversupply.
5.,ExDispatch - Local: Exceptional dispatch to mitigate local congestion.
6.,ExDispatch - System: Exceptional dispatch to mitigate system-wide oversupply.
Note:,Amounts smaller than 1 MW are filtered out for simplicity. Such small curtailments are
occasionally observed when forecasts are lower than Pmin when market will de-commit the unit,
and send the 0 MW dispatch.,
1Only wind and solar resources can be reported in this manner because these resources have a,
forecast. Curtailment is defined as the difference between actual production and the forecast,
when actual production is less than the forecast.,
2The Renewables Watch report provides daily actual renewable production within the ISO grid.,
It is available at: http://www.caiso.com/green/renewableswatch.html.,
"3Congestion occurs when available, least-cost energy cannot be delivered to some loads",
because transmission facilities do not have sufficient capacity to deliver the energy.,
